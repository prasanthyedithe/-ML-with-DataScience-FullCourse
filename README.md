# Data Science ML Full Stack

# 1 | Python Programming and Logic Building
I will prefer Python Programming Language. Python is the best for starting your programming journey. Here is the roadmap of python for logic building.

- Python basics, Variables, Operators, Conditional Statements
- List and Strings
- While Loop, Nested Loops, Loop Else
- For Loop, Break, and Continue statements
- Functions, Return Statement, Recursion
- Dictionary, Tuple, Set
- File Handling, Exception Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Modules and Packages


# 2 | Data Structure & Algorithms
Data Structure is the most important thing to learn not only for data scientists but for all the people working in computer science. With data structure, you get an internal understanding of the working of everything in software.

Understand these topics

- Types of Algorithm Analysis
- Asymptotic Notation, Big-O, Omega, Theta
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked List
- Trees
- Graphs
- Sorting
- Searching
- Hashing


# 3 | Pandas Numpy Matplotlib
Python supports n-dimensional arrays with Numpy. For data in 2-dimensions, Pandas is the best library for analysis. You can use other tools but tools have drag-and-drop features and have limitations. Pandas can be customized as per the need as we can code depending upon the real-life problem.

### Numpy
- Vectors, Matrix
- Operations on Matrix
- Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation
- Reshaping Arrays
- Transpose and Determinant of Matrix
- Diagonal Operations, Trace
- Add, Subtract, Multiply, Dot, and Cross Product.

### Pandas
- Series and DataFrames
- Slicing, Rows, and Columns
- Operations on DataFrame
- Different ways to create DataFrame
- Read, Write Operations with CSV files
- Handling Missing values, replace values, and Regular Expression
- GroupBy and Concatenation


### Matplotlib
- Graph Basics
- Format Strings in Plots
- Label Parameters, Legend
- Bar Chart, Pie Chart, Histogram, Scatter Plot


# 4 | Statistics

### Descriptive Statistics
- Measure of Frequency and Central Tendency
- Measure of Dispersion
- Probability Distribution
- Gaussian Normal Distribution
- Skewness and Kurtosis
- Regression Analysis
- Continuous and Discrete Functions
- Goodness of Fit
- Normality Test
- ANOVA
- Homoscedasticity
- Linear and Non-Linear Relationship with Regression

### Inferential Statistics
- t-Test
- z-Test
- Hypothesis Testing
- Type I and Type II errors
- t-Test and its types
- One way ANOVA
- Two way ANOVA
- Chi-Square Test
- Implementation of continuous and categorical data


# 5 | Machine Learning
The best way to master machine learning algorithms is to work with the Scikit-Learn framework. Scikit-Learn contains predefined algorithms and you can work with them just by generating the object of the class. These are the algorithm you must know including the types of Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Descent
- Random Forest
- Ridge and Lasso Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine
- KMeans Clustering

### Other Concepts and Topics for ML
- Measuring Accuracy
- Bias-Variance Trade-off
- Applying Regularization
- Elastic Net Regression
- Predictive Analytics
- Exploratory Data Analysis

# 7 | Natural Language Processing
If you are interested in working with Text, you should do some of the work an NLP Engineer do and understand the working of Language models.

- Sentiment analysis
- POS Tagging, Parsing,
- Text preprocessing
- Stemming and Lemmatization
- Sentiment classification using Naive Bayes
- TF-IDF, N-gram,
- Machine Translation, BLEU Score
- Text Generation, Summarization, ROUGE Score
- Language Modeling, Perplexity
- Building a text classifier
- Identifying the gender


# 8 | Computer Vision
To work on image and video analytics we can master computer vision. To work on computer vision we have to understand images.

- PyTorch Tensors
- Understanding Pretrained models like AlexNet, ImageNet, ResNet.
- Neural Networks
- Building a perceptron
- Building a single layer neural network
- Building a deep neural network
- Recurrent neural network for sequential data analysis
